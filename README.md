## 1. Introduction
As a Data Engineer, our role is to ensure the efficient extraction, processing, and delivery of Twitter data for sentiment analysis related to Bitcoin. By providing a clean and normalized dataset, we enable the Data Analyst team to perform in-depth analysis and derive meaningful insights.

## 2. Technologies Used
Twitter API v1.1: We leverage the Twitter API to access real-time and historical tweet data, allowing us to gather a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
AWS (Amazon Web Services): We have chosen AWS as the cloud platform of choice due to its robust features, scalability, and availability. It provides the necessary infrastructure to store and process large volumes of data.
Python: We utilize Python as the primary programming language for data extraction, processing, and transformation tasks. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools makes it ideal for working with Twitter data.
Jupyter Notebook: We use Jupyter Notebook for code development, data exploration, and documentation. It provides an interactive environment for iterative development and analysis.
3. Data Extraction
To gather Twitter data, we make use of the Twitter API v1.1. By applying filters such as keywords and relevant accounts, we extract tweets specifically related to Bitcoin. The extraction process ensures we obtain a diverse and comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
Once the tweets are extracted, we perform data preprocessing to ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis. The preprocessing steps may include:

Text cleaning: Removing URLs, special characters, and irrelevant information.
Normalization: Standardizing text, removing capitalization, and handling abbreviations.
Language processing: Tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.
Sentiment scoring: Assigning sentiment scores to each tweet based on predefined criteria.
By applying these preprocessing techniques, we aim to provide a high-quality dataset that can be easily analyzed by the Data Analyst team.

## 5. Data Delivery
As a Data Engineer, our primary objective is to deliver a well-structured and normalized database to the Data Analyst team. The dataset will be organized in a format suitable for analysis, with tables and fields optimized for efficient querying and processing. We ensure that the dataset is free from inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant information, allowing the Data Analyst team to focus on deriving insights from the data.

By delivering a clean and normalized dataset, we enable the Data Analyst team to perform in-depth analysis, such as sentiment trend analysis, correlation with market movements, and identification of key influencers. The final dataset will serve as a reliable foundation for the Data Analyst team to explore the sentiment dynamics of Bitcoin on Twitter and derive valuable insights.
